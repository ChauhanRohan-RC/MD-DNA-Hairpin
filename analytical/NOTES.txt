1. Imposed or Hidden Molecular Free-Energy Profile
    -> for theory:
        PMF theoretically defined by our model
    -> for simulation and experiments:
        PMF implied by extension distribution after deconvolution of instrumental compliance
        implemented in script: test-deconvolve/deconv.py

2. Splitting Probability (or committor) is ALWAYS 0.5 at the barrier top, for BOTH SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC double well pmf
    -> This is TRUE FOR OUR MODEL of double-well pmf,
       For a certain depth, as the asymmetry (bias) is increased, the barrier-top shifts towards the shallower well, retaining half the area on either side of the barrier top
    -> CAUTION: for some other models, asymmetric pmf may lead to SP < 0.5 or Sp > 0.5 at the barrier
