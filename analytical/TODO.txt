## Theory-Experiment Plots

    1. Sample Experimental PMF (PlotDigitizer) and FIT them
        -> symmetric 1.1: bias must be 0
        -> asymmetric 2.1: bias must be high ~ 0.05

    2. Sample corresponding Experimental SP (PlotDigitizer)
        -> symmetric 1.1
        -> asymmetric 2.1

    3. Plots (for 1.1 and 2.1 each)
        -> SP(exp) + SP(theory)
        -> PMF_IM(exp-fit) + PMF(exp) + PMF_RE(theory)

EASY WAY: just take a model-system, and plot
    -> SP(exp) + SP(theory)
    -> PMF_IM(theory-model) + PMF_RE(theory, optional)
